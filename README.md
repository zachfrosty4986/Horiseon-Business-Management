# Week-1-Challenge
Given the code, debugging is needed to allow the web application to run properly for accesibility. "Alt" attributes were added to describe the images used in the web application. The CSS component of this webpage also contained some class bugs, as we can apply many of the stylesheet changes to the header category, instead of the header class. 

I debugged this code because I wangted to make this website and its images more accesible to the visually impared community. I also wanted to allow the code to look neater and more simplified for a behind the scenes look. With a cleaner and better code, it is easier for anyone, including myself to interpret it and for the website application to run more smoothly.
